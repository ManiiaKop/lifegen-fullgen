# This is a file with the mods LifeGen and FullGenetic combined. 
# IMPORTANT : The customisation option does not work when creating your starting cat, it causes the game to crash. The rest of the game seems to work normally.
# Please make sure to DISABLE modded litter for the first night, as it causes the game to crash. The setting can be enabled after, but I'd recommend waiting until your character is 6 moons.
