    "After taking a piece of poisoned prey from the fresh-kill pile, you run back to the nursery to present it to v_c, claiming that it's from a super special kind of squirrel. You then challenge them to eat it. v_c doesn't wake up later after being rushed to the medicine den.",
    "You and v_c decide to sneak outside of camp, exploring the territory on a cold, rainy day. You remember a time when v_c had really gotten on your nerves, so you tell them to stay there and you'll be right back. You leave them there and go back to camp, unknowing to what you'd just sentenced v_c to until their vigil.",
    "You and v_c always play-fight, and today was no different. You decide to be the evil badger whilst v_c is the fearless warrior. After you make one fierce play-tackle, your playtime is brought to an abrupt end, and v_c doesn't wake up again.",
    "You and v_c decide to sneak out of camp and play near a river that borders another Clan. You both have loads of fun playing tag, but things quickly take a sour turn when your friend slips at the edge of the river, and you watch as they're carried away by the current.",
    "Colder temperatures mean that the river has frozen over. The kits take the privilege to play on the ice, slipping and sliding across the banks. You're a more cautious kit, though, choosing to sit at the edge of the river and watch. That seems to have been a good idea - you watch as the ice cracks and crumbles, dunking v_c into the frigid water.",
    "You and v_c have often tried sneaking into the medicine den, every time getting shooed away with a scolding. This time you are successful. While the healer is gone, the two of you have the perfect opportunity to make a mess of their herbs. You challenge v_c to eat one, and they oblige, their lack of knowledge sealing their fate.",
    "It's a sunny day, perfect for a nice play-fight. You and v_c roll around the clearing, jumping on each other's backs and pushing one another to the ground. v_c plays the part of the enemy invading camp, while you are the brave c_n warrior defending the Clan! Suddenly, something seems to go wrong when you shove v_c a bit too hard, and you never see them get back up.",
    "You're sitting on the edge of the nursery after a fight with v_c, when you hear a strange noise. A soft hiss. You see a hole just next to you, just small enough to fit a paw. You quietly growl at v_c telling them that they're a coward and that they'd *never* put their paw inside of this hole. v_c storms over and digs their paw in, where they're bitten by a snake. By the time the queens see, you've already gotten your story straight. v_c was just too nosy for their own good!",
    "The huge shadow of an eagle circles camp, and the queens shuffle all of the kits inside. You whisper to v_c that, maybe if they can chase the eagle off, l_n will be so impressed by their bravery that they'll become an apprentice early! v_c must take your idea to heart, but instead of earning a new name, they're carried off in the hawk's talons, never to be seen again."

  "murder kitten apprentice": [
    "You convince v_c to play a game of 'river crossing' on the stepping stones at the edge of the camp. You pretend to struggle, urging them to help. As they reach for you, you push them, causing them to tumble into the river. Their small, terrified yowls are soon swallowed by the rushing water.",
    "You beg and plead for v_c to take you on an adventure outside of camp, and whilst they're hesitant to do so... they eventually agree! Whilst out, exploring whilst the apprentice teaches you all about the cool areas, you see them slip off of a cliff, barely hanging on. v_c tells you to go get help, but instead you decide to prove how strong you are, and bite their paws until they fall off. Who's gonna be the better warrior now?",
    "You notice v_c looking extremely tired and worn out, barely responding to their peers. Seizing the opportunity, you bring them a piece of crow-food to try and 'cheer them up'. The half-awake apprentice doesn't notice the off stench and vile taste until it's far too late...",
    "You see v_c resting near the edge of a cliff, an excellent opportunity to give them a little scare. You sneak up and pounce on them playfully, but they lose their balance and fall off the edge. What was intended as a joke turns into a horrifying accident.",
    "As v_c demonstrates for the kits how to fish, you decide to play a trick and push them into the water. They lose their footing and get swept away by the current. When they don't resurface, the playful prank turns into a dreadful reality.",
    "v_c is trying to teach you how to leap onto a high ledge. Deciding to add a bit of mischief, you give them a surprise push from behind during their next jump. The unexpected force sends them tumbling onto the jagged rocks below. The intended jest has deadly consequences you never anticipated.",
    "v_c has always been good to you, but you can't help but want to play a harmless prank on them. While they're busy doing something, you tug on their tail, and as soon as they turn to scold you, you run out of camp. You turn around after running for a little bit, and stick your tongue out at them. As they start to scold you, they hear something coming, and stand over your small body to protect you. You realize once their dead body collapses slightly on top of yours, that maybe the prank wasn't so harmless after all.",
    "The huge shadow of an eagle circles camp, and the queens shuffle the kits inside. You whisper to v_c that, maybe if they can chase the eagle off, the Clan leader will be so impressed by their bravery that they'll become a warrior early! v_c must take your idea to heart, but instead of earning a new name, they're carried off in the hawk's talons, never to be seen again."

    "You find a dangerously weak branch hanging over the nursery. You convince v_c to play a game of 'leaping leaf' with you beneath it. During the game, you make sure to vigorously shake the branch, causing it to snap and fall, crushing v_c beneath it.",
    "Trying to make v_c jump with a fake snake, you watch as they sprint into the forest, not aware it's a prank. However, the real threat comes from a concealed badger set they blunder into. When the dust settles, v_c lies still, leaving you to contemplate the grim reality of your prank.",
    "v_c, with their gentle demeanor, always treating you with kindness, becomes the focus of your latest scheme. During their herb gathering, you playfully nudge a large rock from the cliff above them. Their sudden, shocked yelp is the last thing you hear. As you approach their body, you realize the dire consequences of your prank.",
    "You've started to develop an interest in herbs, so you go talk to v_c to learn more about how it's like being a healer apprentice. You ask them if they can take you around to see some of the nearby spots to find herbs. v_c hesitantly agrees, telling you to not leave their side unless they say so. You nod your head, and they sneak you out of camp. As v_c shows you a patch of marigolds, a hawk swoops down and takes them. You stand there in shock for a while. When you return to camp, your worried Clanmates are happy to see you're ok, but not so happy when they see you carrying a hawk feather and hear you explain what happened to v_c.",
    "You bring a strange flower you found growing in the camp to v_c, asking them to identify it with wide eyes. v_c observes it for a moment, before determining that it's comfrey and taking a bite to check. They're stuck in the medicine den for a few days afterwards, eventually dying from eating what the healer determines to be foxglove.",
    "You tell v_c that you spotted a cool new plant growing in a dark corner of camp that they might want. v_c happily accompanies you to go inspect it, and ducks under a ledge to get a better look. You climb up on the ledge and start jumping around and playing on it, only for it to suddenly fall under your paws! You climb out of the rubble with a few minor scratches, but v_c never comes back out..."

    "'Mediator apprentice' is a title v_c proudly wears. They're often busy resolving disputes. One day, you decide to surprise them with a play fight when they're deep in thought. Your small pounce startles them, making them lose their balance and tumble down a steep slope. By the time you scamper after them, they're motionless at the bottom.",
    "v_c's duty as a mediator apprentice often leaves them mentally exhausted. Seeing them resting, you sneak up and pounce on them, intending it as a playful gesture. However, they jerk awake, their startled movement sending them toppling over the cliff they were resting on. The realization dawns upon you as you stare at their lifeless body - your innocent game turned deadly.",
    "With v_c's help, you've learned to climb small trees. Eager to play, you challenge them to a race up a tall oak. Halfway up, v_c missteps and falls, their body striking the ground with a sickening thud. The tree race, intended for fun, turns into a scene of horror.",
    "During a mediation session, you decide to sneak up on v_c to startle them, for a bit of fun. As you leap out, they step back in surprise, falling into a deep, hidden crevice. Their body lies still at the bottom, your harmless prank morphing into a fatal accident.",
    "v_c, being a mediator apprentice, is always seemingly calm and collected, no matter what you say or do to them. This frustrates you, since all you want is some sort of reaction! You yell at them in the middle of camp, and as soon as you're finished, you bolt out of camp, v_c following close behind you. You've finally gotten a reaction from v_c! But just as soon as you start to laugh and boast about your victory, a large dog comes hurtling towards you. v_c grabs you and throws you towards the closest bush, and you hide in it as you watch v_c lose their life over a petty quarrel.",
    "Something bothers you about v_c. Perhaps it's their ability to somehow always be right in their mediation, or maybe it's envy. You tell v_c that you had a fight with your friend, who ran out of camp in anger and won't come back, despite the stormy weather. v_c rushes out of camp in a hurry to make sure that no kit would drown or freeze in the rain, and they never return.",
    "You race up to v_c, squealing that a group of bloodthirsty o_cClan warriors just kidnapped one of your denmates, and since they're the only one that knows the other Clan territories, they need to save them right now! Needless to say, the rival warriors of o_cClan aren't too keen on v_c's accusations ... though when the apprentice's cold body appears on the border the next day, no one knows where they could've gotten that ridiculous idea.",
    "You insist to v_c that their mentor is waiting for them in o_cClan's camp for a routine check-in. Knowing o_cClan isn't keen on trespassers, v_c is reluctant to believe you ... until you bring up that they're already running late, and they don't want to keep a whole Clan waiting. You don't know exactly what the warriors of o_cClan did to the apprentice, but regardless, you never see them again.",
    "You tell v_c that the mediator from o_cClan just dropped off some herbs to help with their running nose, a gift from their Clan to yours. v_c happily laps up the flowers ... which, little do they know, is water hemlock. They die just hours later."

  "murder kitten warrior": [
    "During a severe storm, you beg v_c to help you retrieve a 'lost mossball' up a tree. As they climb the tree to help, they slip, causing them to plummet to their death.",
    "You sneak out of camp when everyone has their backs turned. After some exploring, you come across a snake that makes an odd noise with its tail. As you get closer to it, you hear v_c calling out for you and running in your direction. v_c gets there right in time, throwing you out of the way and getting bit by the snake instead of you. You don't have much time to process what happened, as you hear other warriors coming towards you and v_c. v_c's vigil is held that night.",
    "Wanting to take the path of a healer, you decide to help v_c yourself with their horrible stomach ache they are having. Since the healer is away, you enter their den and grab some 'juniper berries', putting them inside a leaf and delivering them to v_c. They praise you and thank you saying that you are going to make a fine healer as they eat the berries. As your eyes glimmer with hope for your future, the warrior collapses to the ground. That is when you realized you mixed up deathberries and juniper berries...How could you have mixed up medicine and deathberries? You can't help but run away, with tears in your eyes, knowing that you will never be a healer after accidentally killing someone.",
    "As a tiny kitten, you couldn't do much and leave the camp, even with supervision. v_c made sure of this, but you wanna explore as much as possible before any of the other kits in the nursery so you can brag about your adventures. So, as v_c's attention was seen elsewhere, you've wriggle away from their sight outside of the camp and wonder for a bit until you come across a bush blanketed with bright berries, and immediately thought of a silly game to play when the alarming cries from v_c reach your ears. Stuffing your maw full of the berries, you've pretended to gag and tumble across the grass, wanting to give a little laugh and scare to your caregiver. However, as soon as v_c panics and tries to hold you down, a group of Clanmates spot the ordeal and were petrified at the sight, accusing v_c of a heinous act of attempted murder. The skirmish was quick and v_c's body was left covered with scars and hatred. You were left shunned at the sight. You were only playing.",
    "As a young kit, the world outside is dangerous and the queens never let their kits go out of camp. There was a snake that was near the camp exit. You called v_c to toss the snake out of camp but it was too late. v_c's body was bit by the venomous snake, and v_c succumbed to the snake's venom."

  "murder kitten medicinecat": [
    "v_c is always so calm and serious. To make them laugh, you decide to create a hole just outside their den. You watch eagerly as they step into it but the trap isn't harmless as you thought. v_c falls awkwardly, getting seriously injured, and despite their knowledge of herbs, they're unable to save themselves. Your attempt at humor results in a tragedy you never intended.",
    "While exploring the medicine den, you find a strange herb that v_c always hides from the kits. Driven by curiosity and mischief, you mix it with their meal. You didn't mean any harm but when v_c collapses later that day, a pang of guilt hits you. Your prank had a far darker outcome than you intended.",
    "You make a gift for v_c, putting a bunch of the pretty flowers they have on their shelf into a piece of prey. It's a little bit of a gift, and a bit of a prank, and you're happy to give it to them! They accept gratefully, and you leave the den, unaware that some of the pretty flowers you put in v_c's food were poisonous.",
    "You've started to develop an interest in herbs, so you go to talk to v_c to learn more about what it's like being a healer. You ask them if they can take you around to see some of the nearby spots to find herbs. v_c agrees, but tells you not to leave their side unless they say so. You nod your head, and the two of you leave camp. As v_c shows you how to get juniper leaves, a snake rears its head, biting v_c. Not knowing what type of snake it was, v_c tells you that you're both headed back to camp. Now. But right as the two of you reach the camp entrance, v_c collapses. The snake turned out to be venomous."

  "murder kitten mediator": [
    "You had a dream about a scary cat in a scary forest, but the cat was nice. The cat told you about v_c, and how much they loved a specific piece of prey, and how you should give it to them. You excitedly agree, and give it to v_c, who seems shocked and grateful. What you didn't tell v_c was that the scary cat had told you to put two herbs into the prey to make it taste better... But the herbs only ended up killing them.",
    "Why does v_c have to always be right? They've sorted out so many arguments, sure, but it's getting annoying to be told no. You tell v_c that you had a fight with your friend about who was the stronger kit, and they decided to prove it by swimming in the river by themself. v_c rushes out of camp to find the lost kit, and nobody bats an eye toward you when their soaked, drowned body is returned to camp the next day.",
    "v_c takes you aside after you start an argument with someone else, gently trying to reassure you and insist that this isn't worth starting a fight over. You want to be an apprentice, it's not fair! You'll show them all that you're ready to be an apprentice, running out into the territory. v_c chases after you, calling your name, but you don't stop... not until you run out into the road. It's a blur after that, but you're soon on the other side, and v_c is dead before you. Maybe, if they didn't want to be dead, they should've made you an apprentice.",
    "You race up to v_c, squealing that a group of bloodthirsty o_cClan warriors just kidnapped a kit, and since they're the only one that knows the other Clan territories, they need to save them right now! Needless to say, the rival warriors of o_cClan aren't too keen on v_c's accusations ... though when the mediator's cold body appears on the border the next day, no one knows where they could've gotten that ridiculous idea.",

  "murder kitten deputy": [
    "A fire rages throughout the camp! You're carried to safety by the deputy but, once you make it out, you tell v_c that someone they care about is still in the fire. This wasn't true, you just wanted your old moss ball, but you watch them dart back into the fire... they don't come back out.",
    "You were told by the older cats to not play out in the clearing as a dangerous bird was spotted not long ago hovering around. You, and mostly you, were told to settle inside the safety and cool nursery den, but with a kit with a bounce in their steps, you needed the space from the stuffy den. Escaping the sight from the older cats, you tumble outside and frolic in the clearing of the camp, your ears not perking at the shrieking of the bird spotting their meal and the spitting yowls from v_c to grab your attention. When you finally notice the danger you were in, the bird already dives down. However, with v_c more impressive size, instead of twisting your flinging body into its talon, the avian decides to grip the tearful v_c and swoop out of camp with them. The only thing left in the clearing was you, a few floating feathers, and a splatter of blood.",
    "You drop hints to v_c that l_n hasn't been impressed by their performance lately, and what better way for them to prove their worth than with a solo border patrol? Needless to say, when they encounter the huge dog you heard the hunting patrol mention earlier, they aren't too happy. When their body is dragged back to camp, they're barely recognizable."
  ],
  "murder kitten leader": [
    "You sneak into v_c's den bringing them a piece of fresh-kill, claiming you wanted to show them how eager you are for your apprenticeship by catching them some fresh-kill. v_c, though upset that you'd snuck out of camp to do this, eats the fresh-kill without noticing the shiny red berries hidden inside. When v_c's body is found hours later, the whole Clan scrambles to find the culprit, but nobody thinks to point a paw toward an innocent little kitten like yourself.",
    "You're sick of being cooped up in the nursery, so when the healer gives in to your nagging and gives you an herb bundle to give to the leader, of course you accept. Herbs are bitter and gross, you remember, so when the healer isn't looking, you search for something to make the gross herbs taste a little better. You see honey, and you almost grab some before something absolutely delicious-looking catches your eye - shiny red berries. Excitedly, you scoop a bunch of them inside the herb package, a bright grin on your face. You make your way to v_c's den, placing the herb bundle in front of them and explaining that it's from the healer. The leader mews a thank you, but you're not even able to leave the den before you hear v_c start gasping for air. You turn around, panicking, and watch the leader fall to the ground, trembling. You're horrified and are pushed to the side as the healer rushes in. Once they realize that they are too late, the healer turns on you, hissing and growling. You flatten your ears against your head and slowly walk backwards, your tail tucked between your back legs. You don't even know what you've done wrong.",
    "No one would ever suspect that you, a kit, could be capable of laying a hair on the mighty leader of c_nClan's back. When their limp body falls before your little paws, you hope that no one ever makes the mistake of underestimating you again."

  "murder kitten elder": [
    "You bring a bundle of herbs to v_c, claiming that the healer asked you to bring these to them since they're busy at the moment. v_c eats the herbs, not noticing the shiny red berries you'd tucked into the bundle as just a little prank.",
    "It's a nice day out, so you and v_c decide to take a walk outside of camp - with leader's permission. As you explore the new scents and sights around you, you stumble upon a patch of what you assume to be some type of tasty berry! You rush over to v_c to tell them about it, asking if they could pick some to bring back to camp. v_c happily agrees; however, it's only when they fall to the ground, seizing with berry juice covering their jaws, do you realize how dangerous the world really is.",
    "Doesn't good old v_c want to play with you anymore? It's just funny! They were always happy to see you, why are they pretending to be weak now and whining all the time, as if just to keep you behind? You only wanted to play! Therefore, one evening you finally managed to sneak into the elders den, playing with the funny v_c until late at night! They don't talk much but they do pretend to be a menacing badger for your game. Oddly, they fall into a deep slumber right after you 'defeat' them. Thinking that v_c is just tired, you head back to the nursery."

  "murder apprentice kitten": [
    "During a game of hide and seek, you urge v_c to hide in a deep, narrow pit. They tumble in, and when the game ends, v_c is nowhere to be found.",
    "You listen to v_c begging you, once again, to teach them some of the battle moves you learned. You finally relent and tell v_c that you'll teach them later today, but they have to make sure they don't tell anyone. v_c agrees, and later that day, when no one is paying attention, you quickly sneak out of camp with v_c. You teach them the battle moves v_c so desperately wanted to learn, but not in the way they wanted.",
    "You ask a kit out onto a scouting trip to the angry eagle's nest, turning it into a perilous game of who could find an egg the fastest. You lead v_c up a tree and into the branches as the mother bird screeches, grabbing the kit with her strong talons. You smirk as they fly off into the unknown.",
    "You offer to take v_c onto a grand and exciting adventure out of the nursery. You help v_c sneak out and the two of you run into the woods. When you're far enough from camp, you suddenly speed up, leaving v_c behind. You loop back to camp, alone, and no one asks where you've been.",
    "You tell v_c to follow you, saying that you want to show them a shiny treasure you found recently. They happily agree and the two of you sneak out of camp. You lead v_c to a foxes' den, and they never come back out.",
    "You ask v_c if they want to go on a secret mission with you, and they jump excitedly at the opportunity. You lead them out of camp and head towards the Thunderpath together, but v_c never comes back.",
    "You bring v_c a piece of crow-food that you found by the side of the Thunderpath, claiming that it's from a special type of squirrel. They wrinkle their nose at it, but you encourage them to eat it. They don't wake up ever again.",
    "You invite v_c to play a game of hide and seek out of camp with you-in the middle of a snowstorm. You generously let them hide first, and when you're done counting you don't even bother trying to find them. You head straight back to camp and crawl back into your nest, snug and cozy. Later, you hear the warriors calling out for v_c worriedly, but it's no use. By the time the snowstorm is over, it's much too late for v_c."

You grab v_c's paws with a terrified look on your face. You then smirk, you've waited for this moment for a long time. You let them tumble to their death as you see v_c's fearful eyes.",
    "You've heard your older Clanmates speaking of a rat infestation in the territory and you've seen patrols come back battered with rat bites. v_c has always been a nuisance to you, always nagging you to play with them or check out their totally cool new move. Thoughtfully, you pad up to them and tell them that the both of you could become warriors early if you dealt with that rat problem. v_c agrees excitedly. But when the two of you get there and the rats attack, you sprint away, leaving v_c for dead... Their body isn't found until the next day...",
    "You and v_c seem to be constantly challenging each other, always trying to be better than each other. While on a little mission together by the closest river, v_c suggests a mock battle between the two of you. The two of you fight, actually having fun for once but this ends when you push v_c too hard, slamming them into a tree and knocking them out. You stop your mock attack and rush over but you're too late, the body rolls into the nearby river. You stare in fear at what you've done, and dash off to camp. Cats ask where v_c is and soon their mentor asks too, you keep a straight face and answer that you have no idea where they are. They don't seem to have any reason to doubt you. You got away with it but was that really appropriate to think? Either way, you seemed to have won your battle.",
    "You challenge your best friend, v_c, to come with you and fight  the dogs that are  swarming your Clan, you and v_c go to find them and chase them off, maybe you could become warriors faster this way and you will both be praised and known as heroes of the Clan. You two sneak out of camp and decide to find the dogs, however after walking a bit in the direction where the Thunderpath is, two enormous dogs lunge at you both. Shaken but ready to beat them, you both attack them, however, the dogs were much larger and experianced, one of the dogs grabs you and later you black out. You're unsure if you're still alive or not, but then...you hear a familiar voice. You open your eyes, pain surrounding your body, the healer was there in front of you telling you that they found you and you were badly injured. When you ask about your beloved friend, tears fall from the healer's eyes as they point their tail to the lifeless body of v_c. You can't help but live with the fact that your friend died due to your stupid reckless challenge.",
    "You and v_c have liked the same cat for a while now, and you both decide to challenge each other and see who's better. Secretly sparring outside of camp over who was gonna confess when you both became warriors, your mind flashes with jealousy over the thought of v_c with them- And before it even processes in your brain, v_c is lying on the ground with a deadly wound. You two might've been good friends, but your love was stronger than your reasoning.",
    "While out on patrol, you and v_c find an abandoned piece of brown Twoleg food wrapped in a shiny silver leaf. You dare v_c to eat it, and though they're reluctant at first, they quickly scarf it down after finding it's actually quite delicious. Neither of you understand why over the next few days afterward, v_c suddenly grows quite ill and eventually dies.",

    "You tell your former denmate that you found a mysterious bush of berries and ask them to check it out with you. They agree as you set out towards the river. v_c leans down to inspect the shrub, but you sneak behind and push them into the rushing water and hold them down. After a small struggle, they finally join the ancestors above you.",
    "You've always played pranks on v_c. After all, they always overreact, and every reaction from v_c is funnier than the last. You decide to go to the medicine den when only v_c is there, claiming that you have a severe stomach ache. As you lie down on your back being overly dramatic, they realize it's a joke and ask when you are going to grow up. Who are they to tell you to grow up? You decide to lightly claw at v_c's neck to startle them as another prank. However, your claws dig deeper than expected. Guess v_c is the one who'll never grow up.",

    "Tsk. Why would anyone choose to be a mediator? Warriors fight with their claws to defend their honor. How are petty words going to win border fights? You decide to challenge v_c to a battle, to show them how a true warrior fights! When the life begins to leave v_c's eyes, you feel no remorse; the Clan needs strong warriors, not mewling kits.",
    "v_c is constantly on your nerves, holding 'mediating' sessions so often that you can barely get your naps in. When you've had enough, you catch v_c off guard and silence them forever."
  ],
  "murder elder warrior": [
    "Elders are respected... right? Just how much could you get away with? The answer is a lot. You're still reeling from shock at v_c's vigil, but the feeling of their blood on your paws is still so fresh. Thankfully, others think your reaction is normal for any death. A thought haunts your old brain; you're shocked by what you've done, but not.. disgusted. Perhaps seniorhood isn't too late to realize a hidden bloodlust.",
    "The Warrior Code commands that elders are to be respected. And yet here v_c is, rolling their eyes whenever you speak, laughing about you behind your back. You've even heard them muttering with their friends about how useless you are! You politely ask v_c on a walk. When you return to camp, the other cats assume the broad smile on your lips are from the nice weather, not from the feeling of your claws tearing through v_c's pelt."

  "murder elder medicinecat": [
    "As you visit the healer's den for a check-up, you swipe deathberries off of one of the many shelves and hide them under your paws. You tell v_c that you're feeling under the weather, and they give you some feverfew for it. You eat it before spitting it out- screeching and accusing the healer of poisoning it. v_c sighs and insists it's fine, and you slip deathberries into the remaining bundle before they eat it to prove it wasn't poisoned. You watch as they realize what's happening, and leave the den feeling smug about what you'd done.",
    "The healers used to be better, back in the good ol' days. v_c just doesn't cut it. One night, you sneak into their den, ending their life quickly. Perhaps the new healer will be up to par.",
    "v_c is always treating you poorly - and frankly, you like their apprentice a lot more. The younger cat would be better for the Clan anyways, so you decide to take care of the matter yourself.",
    "v_c asks you to help them sort herbs on a day while their quite busy. You slip a pawful of poppy seeds towards the cat while they're not completely looking, and watch as v_c lap them up unknowingly."

  "murder elder mediator": [
    "In your youth, mediators were the epitome of fairness and wisdom. But v_c, their new-age understanding of 'mediation' just irks you. One night, you decide to ensure the Clan retains its honor, doing what must be done. By dawn, v_c's lifeless body lays cold. Surely, this is a dispute they can't settle.",
    "The respect v_c commands as a mediator is laughable at best. They've turned the sacred position into a joke, and it makes your fur bristle with indignation. You take it upon yourself to restore the Clan's dignity. The sun rises to v_c's lifeless body. It seems there's no mediation left for them.",
    "You remember a time when the mediator's word was law, their advice sought and cherished. But v_c? They're nothing more than a yowling kit. Your claws find their mark one quiet night. Come morning, the Clan is one mediator less. Not that v_c was much of one.",
    "The Clan's reverence towards v_c baffles you. As mediator, they've shown nothing but ineptitude. Their false wisdom and showy humility are an affront to all the true mediators before them. With swift, silent action, you do what you believe is right. The next sunrise, v_c won't see. There's no peace for them to broker now.",
    "Mediators are supposed to be voices of reason, voices of peace. But v_c's sly tongue and lazy demeanor have no place in your Clan. You're an elder now, but your warrior's spirit still burns bright. Under the cover of night, you end v_c's reign. Dawn breaks, unveiling your actions. Maybe now, a true mediator will rise.",
    "Mediators were different, back in your day. It was a role that was respected, on par with healers, and dare you say, the deputy. However, v_c puts that role to shame. At some point, you're convinced they took upon the role to get out of patrols. You decide to take care of them, the good old-fashioned way. v_c is found dead the next morning. Try to mediate that.",
    "Get over it? Get OVER it? v_c's poor choice of words burn a hole into your belly, and it would be uncharacteristic for you to not act on it. You're going to show v_c just how stubborn an old cat can be. You're so stubborn, in fact, that you don't release v_c's throat until you're completely and utterly sure there's no chance of them ever saying another word again."
  ],
  "murder elder deputy": [
    "You have served c_nClan faithfully for many moons, dedicated to the Warrior Code and the word of your Clan leader. But v_c as deputy? That pitiful scrap of fur? Absolutely unacceptable. That cat is not suited for this position, and you cannot even count on your four paws the amount of other cats who deserve it more. One night, you set out to 'scare' v_c into giving up their position. Unfortunately, they don't ever wake up again. Shamefully, you slump back to the elders den, unable to face the consequences of your actions.",
    "You join your Clanmates in cheering out the name of the new deputy of c_nClan, v_c. But inside, it feels like claws are tearing apart your heart and soul. YOU should have been up there, the gazes of all your Clanmates on you, and only you - the leader's second-in-command. As the days pass from the ceremony, you feel your heart grow bitter and cold, any sense of comradery fading, until finally only one choice remains - getting rid of v_c. Though you are retired, you are still a skilled fighter, and soon enough, v_c is but a memory in the minds of your Clanmates.",
    "The chosen deputy, v_c, struts around the camp with newfound arrogance, causing your old blood to boil. Jealousy gnaws at your bones like a winter chill. In the shadows of your years, your paws still remember the fight, and v_c becomes a bane you can't ignore.",
    "Watching v_c give out orders, it feels as if your past accomplishments have been forgotten. Pride and resentment coalesce in your heart, propelling you towards an unthinkable act. Once revered, you resort to strategies unbefitting of an elder, but necessary for v_c's end.",
    "Each day, the sight of v_c standing next to the leader eats away at your serenity. Your old eyes, still sharp, start seeing opportunities. A silent battle unfolds between wisdom and jealousy, the end only coming with the deputy's demise.",
    "The once cherished tales of your glory now fall on deaf ears. v_c's reign overshadows your legacy. The pain cuts deep, a wound that festers with every command v_c gives. Unseen, unheard, the resolve forms within you - the deputy must perish.",
    "The bitterness of undeserved obscurity fuels your desire for retribution. Each time v_c leads a patrol or speaks during a Clan meeting, your heart hardens. Like the oldest and most dangerous predator, you bide your time, until the moment is ripe for v_c to meet their fate."
  ],
  "murder elder leader": [
    "You've lived in this Clan for many moons, and you worry about v_c's leadership. The leaders before them led this Clan well, but making them deputy was an awful mistake- And you swore to fight for your Clan's safety, to your final breath. You might be retired, but you still have some strength left in you - the leader finds out when you rip away the rest of their lives in their sleep.",
    "You watched v_c's rise to power. It was a filthy, rotting one. This is not an act of jealousy, you vow silently as v_c bites into the tampered prey. It's an act of justice, you promise, as the rest of their lives wilt away.",
    "Time has been kinder to your mind than your body, but even that couldn't ignore the dangers v_c's leadership brought. Waiting till the moon was high, you made your way to their den, using your remaining strength to strike at them in their sleep.",
    "With the wisdom of many moons behind you, you recognize the signs of a leader leading the Clan to ruin. It pains you to take such drastic measures, but v_c's reign needs to end for the survival of the Clan. You surprise them one night, ending their rule permanently.",
    "Your days as a warrior may be behind you, but the fire of protection still burns in your heart. Seeing v_c's ill-guided decisions, you decide to take action. In the dead of the night, the leader's reign comes to an abrupt end.",
    "The leader's misguided decisions threaten the stability of your Clan. Convinced that your duty as an elder doesn't only limit to sharing stories, you decide to act. It's a quiet night when you creep into v_c's den, ensuring their tyranny ends once and for all.",
    "Your bones might ache, but the pain in your heart aches more. v_c's leadership isn't what your Clan deserves, and so, under the cover of the night, you confront them in their den. The skirmish is short-lived, bringing an end to their rule."

  "murder elder elder": [
    "Countless moons of sharing tales and space with v_c have reached a boiling point. Their ceaseless chatter wears on your last nerve. In a fit of frustration, you force them into a deep sleep from which they won't wake, their stories forever silenced.",

    "The constant squabbles and disagreements with v_c have grown tiresome. Unable to tolerate it anymore, you arrange a fatal accident, leaving v_c to meet the eternal dawn.",
    "You've grown to detest the sight of v_c snoring carelessly each night in the elder's den. One night, driven by resentment, you end their restless sleep forever, leaving them in an eternal slumber.",
    "The shared memories and experiences with v_c now only serve as constant irritants. With the tranquility of night as your shield, you guide them silently to StarClan, their constant prattle silenced in the elders den.",
    "They say familiarity breeds contempt, and at this point you can confirm it. Spending days on end with v_c crowding the elders den is driving you mad. Finally, after another restless night of snoring and grunting, you smother them in their sleep, leaving their lifeless body to be found in the morning.",
    "You've known v_c for the majority of your life. Your hatred of them isn't anything new, but cats always told you that you'll grow to enjoy their company. Well, as your joints start to ache more and more by every passing moon, you realize you're not going to be growing much longer. One morning, the Clan awakes to v_c dead in their nest, and you wailing your poor heart out. It's the best performance you've ever given."

    "The anger that courses through you is uncontrollable. Without thinking, you lash out, and when your vision clears, v_c lies lifeless.",
    "You promise v_c a view of the most beautiful sunset. They don't live to see the sunrise.",
    "Jealousy gnaws at you, watching v_c take all the praise and attention. In the shadows, you make sure they'll never steal your spotlight again.",

  "murder warrior queen": [
    "You always knew v_c had a habit of stepping out of line, getting involved in warrior business when it was none of their concern as a queen. Something had to be done, you chuckle at the thought knowing the Clan will be better off with them. You stumble across a secret on the territory and smirk, this is it. You tell v_c that you found a kitten wandering the territory, and they immediately leap to action and ask you to lead the way. So you do. Through the territory, you run, run, run, then you jump. v_c runs, runs, runs and snaps. Behind you there's a sickening Clank and shrill into the night. You turn around to find the devoted queen in the jaws of a bear trap."
